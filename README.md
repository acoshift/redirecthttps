### Installation

`go get github.com/acoshift/redirecthttps`

### Usage Example

This middleware can be applied in the middleware chain, as follows:

```
middlewares := middleware.Chain(
  // We can put our redirection middleware right here.
  redirecthttps.New(redirecthttps.Config{
    // The redirection mode can be specified below.
    Mode: redirecthttps.OnlyProxy
  }),
)

mux.Handle("/", middlewares(app.Handler()))
```

### Configuration: Redirection Modes

There are three redirection modes, which can be specified before instantiating the middleware.

First, the `OnlyConnectionState` Mode, which only checks the connection state from request.TLS, and perform the redirection if TLS is not present in the request.

Second, the `OnlyProxy` Mode, which only checks the X-Forwarded-Proto header from the request in order to determine if it's using plain HTTP or not. If so, perform the redirection.

Finally, the `All` Mode, which checks both the X-Forwarded-Proto Header AND the request.TLS variable.
